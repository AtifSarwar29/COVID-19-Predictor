# COVID-19-Predictor
##Project Overview:
This project aims to develop an automatic predictor for COVID-19 infection using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of FCS files representing patient specimens, with labels indicating whether the patients are COVID-19 positive (sick) or negative (healthy). The ground truth labels are provided in "EU_label.xlsx," and marker-channels with "use" = 1 are selected from "EU_marker_channel_mapping.xlsx" as the data features.

##Goals:
Develop a robust machine learning model to predict COVID-19 infection based on patient specimens.
Evaluate and fine-tune the model's performance to ensure accurate predictions.
Provide a tool that can assist in diagnosing COVID-19 based on FCS data.
